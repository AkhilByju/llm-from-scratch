# LLM From Scratch

Goal: Implement a transformer-based LLM completely form scratch \
Motivation: learn internals of tokenization, training loops, attention mechanisms, etc. \
Scope: pretraining on WikiText, experimenting with hyperparameters \

## Motivation

- I want to learn and explore Large Language Models
- Understand tokenization and vocobulation methods
- Build progressively more capable models to better understand LLMs
- Compare different architectures and positional encodings (e.g., ALiBi vs. RoPE)
